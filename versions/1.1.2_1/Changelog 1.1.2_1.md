## Removed

- SereneSeasonsExtended - Massive TPS losses, mod not being updated by creator.
- The snow removal after snowstorms caused by the mod Weather2 if it ocurred in a biome where snow is not common, specially in a cold season, won't happen - still pending of testing
- Time of day and night changes depending of the season are vanilla again.

- The mod HourGlass was a dependancy, but I chose to maintain it seen that it has some good quality of life changes, such as no need to all sleep to make time pass faster.


## Known issues

- Tough as nails mod - Drinking water by hand is not working - believe to be a mod related bug/issue
- Weather2 - Shaders are not working correctly with how the mod changes the particles, specially with snowstorms
- Tough As Nails: A Curios Expansion - The slot for insulation pads appears to be broken, will be fixed next patch
