# The event features: 

### Zombies and skeletons will now spawn equipped with a Carrot Sword and wearing Killer Bunny Ears.

***

### When killed, these undead will drop random Easter eggs or a Transmuting Easter Cake.

***

*-Carrot Sword. It is a customization for Sweet Sword and has identical properties and characteristics. You can craft it if you want. When you attack mobs with this sword, small carrot particles are created around the enemy.*
 
*-Killer Rabbit Ears. Grants jump boost and speed to the one who wears them.*
 
*-Chaotic Easter Eggs. There are three types and have similar properties. When thrown at a monster, the egg will break and, depending on its type, will apply a random buff to all monsters in a radius around the point of impact, but will also apply a special effect of the Experience Container. Under the effect of the Experience Container, monsters will drop an increased amount of experience when killed, the stronger and the larger the monster's health, the more bonus experience you will receive. Bonuses to experience from Easter eggs are added together, also increasing the experience gained.*

### Among the Easter eggs are the following types:

*-Rotten Easter Egg. When thrown at a monster, grants it and all monsters in a radius around the target the Experience Container effect and one of three random buffs, namely: Rotten Stench (summons a corpse fly near the target once every 10 seconds); Bone Barrier (blocks the first damage received, regardless of the amount of damage, then disappears); Summon Undead (summons a random undead near the target).*

*-Spiritual Easter Egg. When thrown at a monster, grants it and all monsters in a radius around the target the Experience Container effect and one of three random buffs, namely: Obsession (makes the mob possessed by the spirit of chaos); Cursed Mark (summons up to 5 Crimson Pursuers near the target); Ice Barrier (freezes the attacker).*

*-Monstrous Easter Egg. When thrown at a monster, grants it and all monsters in a radius around the target the Experience Container effect and one of three random buffs, namely: Rampage (increases damage and movement speed of the target), Stimulate (increases speed and attack speed of the target), Living Cocoon (summons Baby Spider after the target dies).*

*-Transmuting Easter Cake. When consumed, transforms your physiology into one of the random forms for a random duration. Can apply one of three random effects: Rabbit Agility (greatly increases your speed and jump height, but reduces your damage by 4 units); Stone Persistence (granting 80% damage resistance, and also grants immunity to stun, but slows you down by 30%); Predator's Desire (Grants you strength III and speed II, but you are constantly hungry). Transmuting Easter Cake can only apply one effect at a time.*
