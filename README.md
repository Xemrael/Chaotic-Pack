# Chaotic Pack

Nothing Special about this pack

Put it together to play with friends with some of the mods we thought would be cooler, while trying to keep a Vanilla++esq gameplay and world

While trying to search for better ways to upload and maintain my packs changes, I stumbled across a great mod named [ModPack Update Checker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modpack-update-checker)
which made me create this repo, since it's one of the ways I have to upload and keep an history of the changes

Still learning a lot from Github, while starting to get my hands on some code as well, so don't expect anything fancy for now 

<sub>(real beginner here don't hurt me)

Getting besides the point, for those who see this and is not my friend, sorry to disappoint that is just an *OkishSimplePut* together modpack, nothing extraordinary.


Yet to have an official image or logo, so have this instead
