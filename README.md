# Chaotic Pack

Nothing Special about this pack
Put it together to play with friends with some of the mods we thought would be the cooler, while trying to keep a Vanilla++esq gameplay and world
I still don't have an official image or logo, so have this instead

While trying to search for better ways to upload and maintain my packs changes, I stumbled across a great mod named [ModPack Update Checker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modpack-update-checker)
This made me create this repo, since it's one of the ways I have to upload and keep a history of the changes of it

Still learning a lot from Github, while starting to get my hands on some code as well, so don't expect anything fancy for now
Getting besides the point, for who sees this and is not my friend, sorry to disappoint that is just an okish simple put together modpack, nothing extraordinary.
